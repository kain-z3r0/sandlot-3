# TODO:
# Handle cases where batter reaches on error, then advances further on same play.
# - Detect if batter name appears twice in same line.
# - First clause is AB result: e.g., ab_result=reaches_on_error_flyball
# - Second clause is baserunning event: e.g., baserunning=batter advances to 3rd
# - Split into two logical tagged entries or preserve as multi-tag line with base_out updates.
